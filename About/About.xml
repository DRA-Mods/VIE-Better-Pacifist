This simple mod slightly modifies how the pacifism is considered by the Vanilla Ideology Expanded - Memes and Structures:

- Attacking pawns does not count as hurting them as long as you don't damage them
- Non-lethal weapons don't count as hurting pawns, unless they actually cause harm or permanent damage or death
- Attacking a downed pawn will always count as hurting them, even with non-lethal weapons
- The list of non-lethal weapons is configurable (with a couple of defaults)
- Applies to "Violence: Abhorrent" when hurting humanoid pawns as well as "Ranching: Disliked" when hurting animals
